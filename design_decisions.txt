Design decisions that TDM made that I considerer wrong for my project.
The libraries libstdc and libstdcxx being static by default.
The pthread library being static.

Design decisions that TDM made that I considerer correct for my project.
The use of SJLJ exceptions.
The use of the pthread library.

So, the plan is to change to SJLJ exceptions now and maybe change to PThread at some future time.
